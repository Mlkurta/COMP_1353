# Snake Game

Avoid running into the walls or the snake itself while you try to eat as  many food pieces as you can. The snake grows for every piece eaten.
The background color randomizes every multiple of a configurable color interval (default is 5).

## Dependencies
Either git-clone to a folder of your choice; or download the folder, open it and have the required files inside.

Most likely, you don't have dudraw installed. To install, run the dudraw_install.py in your preferred IDE or command line first.
